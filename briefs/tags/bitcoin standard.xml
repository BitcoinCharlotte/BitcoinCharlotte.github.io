<p>We were fortunate enough to have Dr. Saifedean Ammous speak at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BitcoinCharlotte/events/249842325/">Bitcoin Charlotte on June 13th, 2018</a>! His book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bitcoin-Standard-Decentralized-Alternative-Central/dp/1119473861">The Bitcoin Standard</a> is highly recommended and his second book <a href="https://saifedean.com/the-fiat-standard/">The Fiat Standard</a> will be released later this year. To get an idea of the principles in his book and what makes "hard" money, click "watch the video" to see his amazing speech in Austria.</p>
