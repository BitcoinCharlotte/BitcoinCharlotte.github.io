<p><small> This song represents the true spirit of bitcoin! Dollar signs distract and wont bring you happiness. They bring you more choices. It‚Äôs not about being rich (although a very nice side effectü§û) - its about empowering the individual, seperation of state and money, and holding wealth for generations which allows us to think long term as a species. This allows us the freedom to build bigger and better and to explore further. Right now we spend all our money as quick as we can because we know its going to be worth less later on. Time to flip the script! "ooooh Lord pass me some more!" </small></p>
